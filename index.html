            <section>
                The program "Development of Web applications with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery/AJAX and Bootstrap" is designed for people
                who have no knowledge or little knowledge of programming on the Web. It starts with presenting techniques for designing and
                developing web pages and applications with HTML/CSS/JavaScript languages. The JavaScript language will be presented in detail
                as it is the basis for more advanced topics that will be presented later such as jQuery/AJAX/JSON/XML and Bootstrap. There will
                also be Web Servers topics where learners will install and use Apache Tomcat as well as Web Hosting and file transfer and
                management issues using tools such as FileZilla. Also included is the presentation of UI & UX design techniques (User Interface & User
                Experience Design) so that learners are able to understand the visualization techniques of a web page, as well as the presentation of
                GitHub and Git, in order for learners to gradually create a portfolio for their personal or professional development in the labor market
